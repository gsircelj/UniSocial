## About The Project

Student years are among the most important periods of a person's life, in which he can meet key acquaintances and acquire communication skills that will come in handy in the future, both in private and professional life.

As students, we saw first hand the difference between people who are naturally open and people who struggle to socialize, and we especially saw the struggles of foreign students who come to study in a country where they feel like foreigners, where the culture and the language further hinders the making of new friendships.

<b>
This is exactly why we made UniSocial. The application makes it possible to meet new friends through an algorithm that automatically brings two people together through the interests and hobbies that the person chooses. The advantage of this algorithm is that the ice breaking is done by the application.
